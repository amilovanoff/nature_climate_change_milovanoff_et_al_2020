# How to use this repository
This repository will not be updated but can be cloned and serve as an example to develop trade-linked multilevel life cycle assessment. There are two ways to use this repository:
* Install the model, reproduce it and re-use it for your own research. Note: After downloading the repository, change the working directory of the 1-model_set_up.py and 2-simulations.py scripts to the repository directory (e.g., C:/Users/Alexandre/GitHub/jie_milovanoff_et_al_2020).
* Download the repository and extract the numerical values of the simulations presented in [outputs](https://github.com/amilovanoff/jie_milovanoff_et_al_2020/tree/master/outputs) folder.

Feel free me to contact if you have any questions via email (alexandre.milovanoff@mail.utoronto.ca) or by GitHub @amilovanoff.
